# Breast Cancer Classification â€“ Decision Tree and SVM

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 2 in the course IDATG2208 - Introduction to Machine Learning.
This project analyzes and compares Decision Tree, Linear SVM, and RBF SVM models on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using scikit-learn.
The goal is to evaluate generalization, interpretability, and performance across multiple metrics (accuracy, AUC, F-scores).
